Risk Assessment and Bias in Automated Systems – Case Study

This repository contains the implementation for Task 2 of the course DLMDSME01 – Model Engineering at IU.
The project explores the behavior of machine learning classifiers for predicting criminal recidivism and addresses fairness and bias using the COMPAS dataset.

Objectives
Train and evaluate ML classifiers (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.)
Compare model performance (Precision, Recall, F1)
Explore bias and fairness metrics
Apply debiasing techniques
Reflect on the trade-offs between fairness, interpretability, and accuracy
